## The 24 Logical Fallacies

### Fallacies of Relevance

#### 1. Ad Hominem
**Definition**: Attacking the person instead of the argument.  
**Example**: "You can't trust his economic analysis, he's never run a business."  
**Fix**: Evaluate arguments on their merits, not their source.

#### 2. Appeal to Authority
**Definition**: Citing authority as sole proof.  
**Example**: "Dr. X says this crypto will 100x, so it's true."  
**Fix**: Check evidence, credentials, and conflicts of interest.

#### 3. Appeal to Ignorance
**Definition**: Claiming true because not proven false.  
**Example**: "No one has proven AI can't be conscious, so it is."  
**Fix**: Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence.

#### 4. Appeal to Emotion
**Definition**: Manipulating emotions instead of presenting facts.  
**Example**: "Think of the children! We must ban this now!"  
**Fix**: Separate emotional appeal from logical merit.

#### 5. Straw Man
**Definition**: Misrepresenting opponent's argument.  
**Example**: "So you want to let criminals go free?" (misrepresenting prison reform)  
**Fix**: State opponent's view in their strongest form.

### Fallacies of Presumption

#### 6. False Dichotomy
**Definition**: Presenting only two options when more exist.  
**Example**: "Either we cut costs or go bankrupt."  
**Fix**: Look for third ways, creative solutions.

#### 7. Circular Reasoning
**Definition**: Conclusion assumed in premise.  
**Example**: "X is true because X is true."  
**Fix**: Verify premises independently.

#### 8. Hasty Generalization
**Definition**: Conclusion from insufficient sample.  
**Example**: "This trading strategy worked 3 times, it's a winner!"  
**Fix**: Require statistical significance, larger samples.

#### 9. Slippery Slope
**Definition**: Claiming A will inevitably lead to Z.  
**Example**: "If we allow remote work, productivity will collapse."  
**Fix**: Examine each step, identify where chain breaks.

### Fallacies of Causation

#### 10. Post Hoc
**Definition**: A before B, therefore A caused B.  
**Example**: "Revenue increased after we changed the logo, the logo worked!"  
**Fix**: Look for confounding variables, controlled studies.

#### 11. Confusing Correlation
**Definition**: Correlation implies causation.  
**Example**: "Ice cream sales correlate with drownings, so ice cream causes drowning."  
**Fix**: Consider common causes, direction of causality.

#### 12. Single Cause
**Definition**: Complex outcome attributed to one cause.  
**Example**: "The project failed because of bad marketing."  
**Fix**: Map multiple contributing factors.

### Fallacies of Ambiguity

#### 13. Equivocation
**Definition**: Using word with multiple meanings.  
**Example**: "Theory of evolution is just a theory."  
**Fix**: Define terms precisely.

#### 14. Amphiboly
**Definition**: Grammatical ambiguity.  
**Example**: "I shot an elephant in my pajamas."  
**Fix**: Restate clearly, remove ambiguity.

### Statistical Fallacies

#### 15. Base Rate Neglect
**Definition**: Ignoring prior probability.  
**Example**: "The test is 99% accurate and positive, so I definitely have it." (ignoring 0.1% base rate)  
**Fix**: Always start with base rate.

#### 16. Gambler's Fallacy
**Definition**: Past events affect independent probabilities.  
**Example**: "The coin landed heads 5 times, tails is due!"  
**Fix**: Independent events have no memory.

#### 17. Regression Fallacy
**Definition**: Attributing regression to mean to intervention.  
**Example**: "The punishment worked, performance improved." (it was going to anyway)  
**Fix**: Understand regression to mean.

#### 18. Texas Sharpshooter
**Definition**: Cherry-picking data to fit pattern.  
**Example**: Highlighting only successful trades, hiding losses.  
**Fix**: Pre-commit to metrics, full disclosure.

### Cognitive Fallacies

#### 19. Confirmation Bias
**Definition**: Seeking confirming, ignoring disconfirming evidence.  
**Example**: Only reading articles that support your investment thesis.  
**Fix**: Active disconfirmation, red teaming.

#### 20. Availability Heuristic
**Definition**: Judging by easily recalled examples.  
**Example**: "Startups fail because I read about 3 that did."  
**Fix**: Look for systematic data, base rates.

#### 21. Sunk Cost
**Definition**: Continuing due to past investment.  
**Example**: "We've spent $100k, we can't quit now."  
**Fix**: Evaluate future value only.

#### 22. Survivorship Bias
**Definition**: Only looking at successes.  
**Example**: Studying unicorn startups without looking at failures.  
**Fix**: Study failures equally.

#### 23. Anchoring
**Definition**: Over-relying on first piece of information.  
**Example**: First price mentioned becomes reference point.  
**Fix**: Generate multiple anchors.

#### 24. Framing Effect
**Definition**: Different presentation, different decision.  
**Example**: "90% survival" vs "10% mortality" — same fact, different feel.  
**Fix**: Reframe in multiple ways.

## Fallacy Detection Protocol

```
When evaluating an argument:

1. IDENTIFY the conclusion
2. LIST the premises
3. CHECK each fallacy type
4. ASSESS the severity
5. DECIDE: Valid, Flawed, or Reject
```

---

## Kbot Application

### Pre-Launch Check
```
Argument: "This will succeed because..."

Fallacy Check:
├─ Hasty generalization? [Check sample size]
├─ Survivorship bias? [Check failure rate]
├─ Confirmation bias? [Seek disconfirming evidence]
└─ False dichotomy? [Look for third ways]
```

### Decision Review
```
Decision to pivot:
├─ Sunk cost fallacy? [Is past clouding judgment?]
├─ Availability heuristic? [Is recent failure overweighted?]
└─ Anchoring? [Is original plan too sticky?]
```
