# Mental Models Library

**Source**: https://github.com/cyperx84/claude-skills-mental-models  
**Adapted for**: Kimi Code CLI / Kbot  
**Purpose**: Bayesian decision-making and critical thinking toolkit

---

## Overview

This skill provides 100+ mental models for better decision-making and problem-solving. Originally designed for Claude Code, adapted for Kbot's Cambrian business strategy.

## Core Categories

### 1. Bayesian Thinking
- **Base Rate Neglect** - Always start with prior probabilities
- **Updating Beliefs** - Revise confidence with new evidence
- **Avoiding Overconfidence** - Calibrate predictions

### 2. Systems Thinking
- **Feedback Loops** - Identify reinforcing/balancing loops
- **Stock and Flow** - Understand accumulation over time
- **Emergence** - Whole is greater than sum of parts

### 3. Critical Thinking
- **First Principles** - Break down to fundamental truths
- **Inversion** - Solve backwards from failure
- **Second-Order Thinking** - Consequences of consequences

### 4. Business Strategy
- **Pareto Principle** - 80/20 focus
- **Network Effects** - Value increases with scale
- **Moat Analysis** - Defensible competitive advantage

## Usage in Kbot

### For Decision Evaluation
```
Apply: [Mental Model Name]
Context: [Current situation]
Analysis: [How the model applies]
Confidence: [0-100% Bayesian probability]
```

### For Kill Criteria Review
```
Model: Inversion
Question: What would guarantee failure?
Evidence: [List failure indicators]
Probability of Kill: [Calculated %]
```

### For Parallel Validation
```
Model: Opportunity Cost
Comparison: [Option A vs Option B]
Trade-offs: [What we give up]
Expected Value: [EV calculation]
```

## Quick Reference Card

| Situation | Model | Application |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| Uncertain outcome | Bayesian Update | Start with base rate, adjust with evidence |
| Complex system | Causal Loop | Map feedback loops, identify leverage points |
| Too many options | Inversion | Eliminate bad options first |
| Resource constraint | Pareto | Focus on 20% driving 80% results |
| Competition analysis | Moat | Evaluate defensibility |

## Integration with Kbot Workflow

1. **Pre-Launch**: Apply inversion to identify failure modes
2. **Validation**: Use Bayesian updating on KPIs every 10 minutes
3. **Pivot/Kill**: Second-order thinking on consequences
4. **Scale**: Network effects and moat analysis
