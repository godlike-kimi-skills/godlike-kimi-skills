# System Thinking

**Purpose**: Understanding complex interactions and feedback loops  
**Type**: Strategic Tool  
**Priority**: P1 (For scaling decisions)

## Core Concepts

### Stocks and Flows
```
Stock = Accumulation (e.g., user base, revenue)
Flow = Rate of change (e.g., new users/day, churn)

Revenue = ∫ (Income - Expenses) dt
```

### Feedback Loops

| Type | Icon | Effect | Example |
|------|------|--------|---------|
| Reinforcing | R | Amplifies change | Viral growth |
| Balancing | B | Stabilizes | Market saturation |

## Kbot Business Model as System

```
[Input] Crypto Payments
    ↓
[Process] AI Automation
    ↓
[Output] Services/Deliverables
    ↓
[Feedback] Revenue → Reinvestment
    ↓
[Stock] Stablecoin Reserve
```

### Key Loops

**R1: Growth Loop**
```
Revenue ↑ → Kimi Tokens ↑ → Capability ↑ → Revenue ↑
```

**B1: Cost Constraint**
```
Revenue ↑ → Costs ↑ → Margin Pressure → Efficiency Focus
```

**B2: Market Saturation**
```
Market Share ↑ → Remaining Market ↓ → Growth Rate ↓
```

## Leverage Points

Where small changes produce big results:

| Rank | Intervention | Impact |
|------|--------------|--------|
| 1 | Mindset/Paradigm | Transforms everything |
| 2 | System Goal | Changes direction |
| 3 | Information Flow | Enables better decisions |
| 4 | Self-Organization | Enables adaptation |
| 5 | Rules/Incentives | Changes behavior |

## Causal Loop Diagram Template

```
[Variable A] --(+)-> [Variable B]
     ↑                    |
     |_________(-)________|

(+): Same direction change
(-): Opposite direction change
```

## Application: Kill Criteria as Balancing Loop

```
Performance < Threshold 
    ↓
Kill Signal Generated
    ↓
Resources Reallocated
    ↓
Portfolio Quality ↑
    ↓
Overall Success Rate ↑
```

## Warning Signs

System in trouble:
- [ ] Delayed feedback hiding problems
- [ ] Tragedy of commons (overuse shared resources)
- [ ] Escalation (arms race with competitors)
- [ ] Shifting burden (quick fixes erode fundamentals)
